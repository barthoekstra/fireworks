## Abstract
Fireworks are important parts of celebrations globally, but little remains known about their effect on wildlife. The synchronized and extraordinary use of fireworks on New Year's Eve causes a strong flight response in birds. We use weather radar and systematic bird counts to quantify how flight response differs across bird communities and determine the distance-dependence of this relationship. On average, approximately 1000 times more birds were in flight during New Yearâ€™s Eve than on regular nights. We found disturbance from fireworks decreases with distance, most strongly in the first 5 km, but overall flight activity remained elevated tenfold up to about 10 km. We found that communities of large-bodied species respond more strongly than those of smaller birds. Given the pervasive nature of this disturbance, mitigation should be achieved by establishing large firework-free zones or concentrating fireworks in urban centers. Conservation action should prioritize the most disturbance-prone, larger-bodied, bird communities.
