## Abstract
Fireworks are important parts of celebrations and festivals globally, but little remains known about their effect on wildlife. The sudden synchronized lighting of fireworks on New Year's Eve causes a strong flight response in birds. We use weather radar and systematic bird counts to quantify how flight response differs across bird communities and determine the distance-dependence of this relationship. On average, approximately 1000 times more birds were in flight during New Yearâ€™s Eve than on regular nights. We found disturbance decreased up to 5km from fireworks, but flight activity remained elevated by a factor of 10. We found that communities of large-bodied species respond more strongly than those of smaller birds. Given the pervasive nature of this disturbance, mitigation should be achieved by establishing large firework-free zones or concentrating fireworks in urban centers. Conservation action should prioritize the most disturbance-prone, larger-bodied, bird communities.
