	abstract = {To satisfy the needs of the meteorological and aeroecological communities wanting a simple but effective way of flagging each other’s unwanted echo for a variety of different operational radar systems, we evaluated the ability of an estimate of depolarization ratio (DR) based on differential reflectivity ( Z
              DR
              ) and copolar correlation coefficient ( ρ
              HV
              ) measurements to separate both types of echoes. The method was tested with data collected by S- and C-band radars used in the United States and Canada. The DR-based method that does not require training achieved 96\% separation between weather and biological echoes. Since the misclassifications are typically caused by isolated pixels in the melting layer or at the edge of echo patterns, the addition of a despeckling algorithm considerably reduces further these false alarms, resulting in an increase in correct identification approaching 99\% on test cases.},
