## How to use this document {-}

### Knit it {-}
Use the following line in the console or click `Build Book` in RStudio.

```{r include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book(input = "index.Rmd", output_format = "bookdown::gitbook", clean = TRUE)
```

### Full-reproduction mode {-#full-repro-mode}
In the spirit of reproducibility, the entire analysis, which happens to be contained in this book, can theoretically be reproduced at the push of a button. To facilitate faster reproduction, some code chunks are only run when `full-reproduction` mode is switched on. This can be done by setting the R variable `full_repro` to `TRUE` in `build_bookdown.R`.
