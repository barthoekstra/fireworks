# Preface {-}

## Abstract {-}

Fireworks are important parts of celebrations globally, but little remains known about their effect on wildlife. The synchronized and extraordinary use of fireworks on New Year's Eve causes a strong flight response in birds. We use weather radar and systematic bird counts to quantify how flight response differs across bird communities and determine the distance-dependence of this relationship. On average, approximately 1000 times more birds were in flight during New Yearâ€™s Eve than on regular nights. We found disturbance from fireworks decreases with distance, most strongly in the first 5 km, but overall flight activity remained elevated tenfold up to about 10 km. We found that communities of large-bodied species respond more strongly than those of smaller birds. Given the pervasive nature of this disturbance, mitigation should be achieved by establishing large firework-free zones or concentrating fireworks in urban centers. Conservation action should prioritize the most disturbance-prone, larger-bodied, bird communities.

## How to use this document {-}

### Knit it {-}
Use the following line in the console or click `Build Book` in RStudio.

```{r include=TRUE, eval=FALSE}
bookdown::render_book(input = "index.Rmd", output_format = "bookdown::bs4_book", clean = TRUE)
```

### Full-reproduction mode {-#full-repro-mode}
In the spirit of reproducibility, the entire analysis, which happens to be contained in this book, can theoretically be reproduced at the push of a button. To facilitate faster reproduction, some code chunks are only run when `full-reproduction` mode is switched on. This can be done by setting the R variable `full_repro` to `TRUE` in `build_bookdown.R`.
